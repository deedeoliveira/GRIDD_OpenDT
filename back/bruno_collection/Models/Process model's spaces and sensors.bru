  # Process a model
  
  ## Description
  
  Read an IFC file to find sensors and information related to them (guid, name, guid of the space they are located in, location (x / y / z) of the sensor). The sensors are then stored in the database. If there is already a sensor with the same GlobalId (guid) and model_id, it is not created again.
