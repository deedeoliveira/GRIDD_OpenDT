APS (Autodesk Platform Services) is a cloud-based developer platform which offers API for developer to create applications, integrations and extensions around Autodesk solutions. To create a digital twin web platform to visualize buildings, APS main advantage is the ability to interact with Autodesk’s solutions that are mainly designed towards the AEC field. Furthermore, they provide a web viewer SDK API, which is a powerful tool to visualize 2D and 3D models in a web application.
However, APS, like most of APS solutions is proprietary software and is not open-source.
